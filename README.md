  [Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0kOkyEowME)

#### Summary:
<p>In this week, I tried to explore rhythm in a three-dimension space. To acheive the goal, I used a-frame, p5.js and Tone.js to create a simple staging drumpad. Users can explore rhythm by changing their location in the space as well as clicking different primitive shapes. </p>

#### Interaction:
- Click primitive shapes to play beats. Beats will be repeated based on a preset
- Click the shape again to make the beat stop playing
- Move yourself right and left (x value) to change volume of the rhythm
- Move forward and backward to change the tempo 
- Rotate your camera to "up" and then press up arrow to change the swing of the rhythm (swing can add a bit subdivisions to the notes)

#### Next Step:
- Make the sound more spacial based on the relation position of the user and shapes
- Animate the shape while the beat is playing
